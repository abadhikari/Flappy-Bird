# Flappy-Bird
Created a copy of Flappy Bird using the same spritesheet for deep learning and also to learn a little game-development. Intention was to get a working game for normal people and then refractor it for machine learning. End goal is to get A3C or even Rainbow agent playing it. 

To play: Run the game file.
