# Flappy-Bird
Created a copy of Flappy Bird using the same spritesheet for deep learning and also to learn a little game-development. Intention was to get a working game for normal people and then refractor it for machine learning. End goal is to get A3C or even Rainbow agent playing it. 

New Features:

	- The background will change to night or day according to a function that determines the approximate sunset and sunrise of the current day in relation to the year.
	
	- Render the score as sprites instead of simply using text.
	
	- Gameover menu contains the score and high score as well as a medal system (bronze, silver, gold) depending on the score. 
	
	- The high score is recorded and stored in the highscore.json file. 

To play: run the game file.
